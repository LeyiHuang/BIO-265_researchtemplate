# Dynamic Modeling of Cell Death: The Role of Death Ligand in Apoptosis

Authors: Leyi Huang, Minh Tu

## Overview
This is our repository for the BIO265 Final Project. We investigate the role of  the Fas ligand (FasL) degradation in the caspase casde during apoptosis via an ODE-based model with Caspase-8, Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bid. Runnable code is included in the BIO265_Final_ODE.ipynb file.
